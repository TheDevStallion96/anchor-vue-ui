Based on the review of your repository, here are the key areas where you can improve:

1. Testing Implementation
Your project currently lacks testing infrastructure. Adding:
- Unit tests with Vitest for components
- End-to-end tests with Playwright or Cypress
would significantly improve code reliability and make maintenance easier.

2. Type Safety
Implementing TypeScript would provide better type safety and improve code maintainability, especially given the complexity of Docker management features.

3. Documentation Improvements
While you have good structural documentation, consider adding:
- API documentation for component props and events
- Usage examples for common components
- JSDoc comments for utility functions and composables

4. Code Organization
Your component structure is good, but consider:
- Breaking down larger components in the features directory into smaller, more manageable pieces
- Moving Docker-specific logic into dedicated composables
- Implementing error boundaries for better error handling

5. Performance Optimizations
Implement:
- Code splitting for routes to reduce initial bundle size
- Lazy loading for less frequently used components
- WebSocket support for real-time updates of container states

6. User Experience
Consider adding:
- Dark/Light theme support
- Internationalization for broader user base
- Better error feedback mechanisms
- Loading states for async operations

7. Build Process
Your Vite configuration could be enhanced with:
- Better chunk splitting strategies
- Asset optimization configurations
- Development-specific tooling

8. Security
Strengthen the application by:
- Implementing input validation consistently
- Adding proper error handling for API calls
- Ensuring secure communication with the Docker API
- Adding proper sanitization for user inputs

Your project has a solid foundation with Vue 3, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, but implementing these improvements would make it more robust and production-ready.
